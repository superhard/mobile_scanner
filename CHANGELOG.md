## 6.0.0

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

* [iOS] iOS 15.5.0 is now the minimum supported iOS version.
* [iOS] Updates MLKit to version 7.0.0.
* [iOS] Updates the minimum supported XCode version to 15.3.0.

Improvements:
* [MacOS] Added the corners and size information to barcode results.
* [MacOS] Added support for `analyzeImage`.
* [MacOS] Added a Privacy Manifest.
* [web] Added the size information to barcode results.
* [web] Added the video output size information to barcode capture.
* Added support for barcode formats to image analysis.
* Updated the scanner to report any scanning errors that were encountered during processing.
* Introduced a new getter `hasCameraPermission` for the `MobileScannerState`.
* Fixed a bug in the lifecycle handling sample. Now instead of checking `isInitialized`,
the sample recommends using `hasCameraPermission`, which also guards against camera permission errors.
* Updated the behavior of `returnImage` to only determine if the camera output bytes should be sent.
* Updated the behavior of `BarcodeCapture.size` to always be provided when available, regardless of `returnImage`.

Bugs fixed:
* Fixed a bug that would cause the scanner to emit an error when it was already started. Now it ignores any calls to start while it is starting.
* [MacOS] Fixed a bug that prevented the `anaylzeImage()` sample from working properly.

## 5.2.3

Deprecations:
* The `EncryptionType.none` constant has been deprecated, as its name was misleading. Use `EncryptionType.unknown` instead.

Bugs fixed:
* Fixed `EncryptionType` throwing on invalid `SAE` encryption type.
* [web] Removed the `controls` attribute on the video preview.

Improvements:
* All enum types for barcode data (i.e. Wifi type or email type) now return `unknown` for unrecognized values.

## 5.2.2

Improvements:
* [MacOS] Adds Swift Package Manager support.
* [MacOS] Adds support for `returnImage`.
* Added a new `size` property to `Barcode`, that denotes the bounding box of the barcode.

Bugs fixed:
* Fixed some documentation errors for the `size` and `image` of `BarcodeCapture`.
* [iOS] Fixed a bug with `returnImage`.
* [Android/iOS] Adjusted the raw barcode scan value to pass the raw event data, like on MacOS.

## 5.2.1

* Updates the `package:web` dependency to use a version range.

## 5.2.0

This release requires Flutter 3.22.0 and Dart 3.4.

* [Android] Fixed a leak of the barcode scanner.
* [Android] Fixed a crash when encountering invalid numbers for the scan window.
* [Web] Migrates `package:web` to 1.0.0.

## 5.1.1
* This release fixes an issue with automatic starts in the examples.

## 5.1.0
This updates reverts a few breaking changes made in v5.0.0 in order to keep things simple.

* The `onDetect` method has been reinstated in the `MobileScanner` widget, but is nullable. You can
still listen to `MobileScannerController.barcodes` directly by passing null to this parameter.
* The `autoStart` attribute has been reinstated in the `MobileScannerController` and defaults to true. However, if you want
to control which camera is used on start, or you want to manage the lifecycle yourself, you should set
autoStart to false and manually call `MobileScannerController.start({CameraFacing? cameraDirection})`.
* The `controller` is no longer required in the `MobileScanner` widget. However if provided, the user should take care 
of disposing it.
* [Android] Revert Gradle 8 back to Gradle 7, to be inline with most Flutter plugins and prevent build issues.
* [Android] Revert Kotlin back from 1.9 to 1.7 to be inline with most Flutter plugins. Special 1.9 functionality
has been refactored to be compatible with 1.7.


## 5.0.2
Bugs fixed:
* Fixed a crash when the controller is disposed while it is still starting. [#1036](https://github.com/juliansteenbakker/mobile_scanner/pull/1036) (thanks @EArminjon !)
* Fixed an issue that causes the initial torch state to be out of sync.

Improvements:
* Updated the lifeycle code sample to handle not-initialized controllers.

## 5.0.1
Improvements:
* Adjusted the platform checks to use the defaultTargetPlatform API, so that tests can use the correct platform overrides.

## 5.0.0
This major release contains all the changes from the 5.0.0 beta releases, along with the following changes:

Improvements:
* [Android] Remove the Kotlin Standard Library from the dependencies, as it is automatically included in Kotlin 1.4+

## 5.0.0-beta.3
**BREAKING CHANGES:**

* Flutter 3.19.0 is now required.
* [iOS] iOS 12.0 is now the minimum supported iOS version.
* [iOS] Adds a Privacy Manifest.

Bugs fixed:
* Fixed an issue where the camera preview and barcode scanner did not work the second time on web.

Improvements:
* [web] Migrates to extension types. (thanks @koji-1009 !)

## 5.0.0-beta.2
Bugs fixed:
* Fixed an issue where the scan window was not updated when its size was changed. (thanks @navaronbracke !)

## 5.0.0-beta.1
**BREAKING CHANGES:**

* The `width` and `height` of `BarcodeCapture` have been removed, in favor of `size`.
* The `raw` attribute is now `Object?` instead of `dynamic`, so that it participates in type promotion.
* The `MobileScannerArguments` class has been removed from the public API, as it is an internal type.
* The `cameraFacingOverride` named argument for the `start()` method has been renamed to `cameraDirection`.
* The `analyzeImage` function now correctly returns a `BarcodeCapture?` instead of a boolean.
* The `formats` attribute of the `MobileScannerController` is now non-null.
* The `MobileScannerState` enum has been renamed to `MobileScannerAuthorizationState`.
* The various `ValueNotifier`s for the camera state have been removed. Use the `value` of the `MobileScannerController` instead.
* The `hasTorch` getter has been removed. Instead, use the torch state of the controller's value.
  The `TorchState` enum now provides a new value for unavailable flashlights.
* The `autoStart` attribute has been removed from the `MobileScannerController`. The controller should be manually started on-demand.  
* A controller is now required for the `MobileScanner` widget.
* The  `onPermissionSet`, `onStart` and `onScannerStarted` methods have been removed from the `MobileScanner` widget. Instead, await `MobileScannerController.start()`.
* The `startDelay` has been removed from the `MobileScanner` widget. Instead, use a delay between manual starts of one or more controllers.
* The `onDetect` method has been removed from the `MobileScanner` widget. Instead, listen to `MobileScannerController.barcodes` directly.
* The `overlay` widget of the `MobileScanner` has been replaced by a new property, `overlayBuilder`, which provides the constraints for the overlay.
* The torch can no longer be toggled on the web, as this is only available for image tracks and not video tracks. As a result the torch state for the web will always be `TorchState.unavailable`.
* The zoom scale can no longer be modified on the web, as this is only available for image tracks and not video tracks. As a result, the zoom scale will always be `1.0`.

Improvements:
* The `MobileScannerController` is now a ChangeNotifier, with `MobileScannerState` as its model.
* The web implementation now supports alternate URLs for loading the barcode library.

## 4.0.1
Bugs fixed:
* [iOS] Fixed a crash with a nil capture session when starting the camera. (thanks @navaronbracke !)

## 4.0.0
**BREAKING CHANGES:**

* [Android] compileSdk has been upgraded to version 34.
* [Android] Java version has been upgraded to version 17.

## 3.5.7

* The `BarcodeCapture` class now exposes a `size`.
* The list of `corners` of a `Barcode` is now non-null.

Bugs fixed:
* Fixed the default values for the `format` and `type` arguments of the Barcode constructor.
  These now use `BarcodeFormat.unknown` and `BarcodeType.unknown`, rather than `BarcodeFormat.ean13` and `BarcodeType.text`.
  (thanks @navaronbracke !)
* Fixed messages not being sent on the main thread for Android, iOS and MacOS. (thanks @navaronbracke !)

## 3.5.0

* Fixed a crash on iOS when the device is nil. (thanks @navaronbracke !)
* Fixed a case of an unhandled exception when starting the scanner. (thanks @navaronbracke !)

Improvements:
* Improved MacOS memory footprint by using a background queue. (thanks @ryanduffyne !)

## 3.4.1
* Changed MediaQuery.sizeOf(context) to of(context).size for compatibility with older Flutter versions.

## 3.4.0
New Features:
* This PR adds an option to add an overlay to the scanner which is only visible when the scanner has started. (thanks @svenopdehipt !)

Improvements:
* fix a bug in the static interop binding of PhotoCapabilities (thanks @navaronbracke !)
* [Web] add the corners from the ZXing result to the barcode on web (thanks @navaronbracke !)
* update the example app web entrypoint to the latest template by running flutter create . --platforms=web (thanks @navaronbracke !)
* add better handling for the case where scanning barcodes is unsupported (for example a desktop running the browser sample) (thanks @navaronbracke !)
* [Web] fix the permission denied handling on the web, by using the NotAllowedError error message as defined by MDN (thanks @navaronbracke !)
* add app bars with back buttons to the example app (so that you can go back easily) (thanks @navaronbracke !)

* [iOS] Implements a fix from issue iOS After first QR Code Scan, When Scanning again, First Image stays on Camera buffer (thanks @FlockiiX !)

* By dynamically adjusting the positioning and scaling of the scan window relative to the texture, the package ensures optimal coverage and alignment for scanning targets. (thanks @sdkysfzai !)
* In the original package, If there are multiple barcode/qrcodes in the screen, the scan would randomly pick up any barcode/qrcode that shows in the screen, This upgrade fixes it and picks on the qrcode/barcode that is in the center of the camera. (thanks @sdkysfzai !)
* In the original package if you changed the camera size, it would still pick scans even if the barcode are not shown in the screen, This issue is also fixed in the upgraded packaged. (thanks @sdkysfzai !)

* [iOS] This removes a threading warning (and potentially jank). (thanks @ened !)
* [Android] fix(ScanImage): fix android image result is not correct format and orientation (thanks @phanbaohuy96 !)

## 3.3.0
Bugs fixed:
* Fixed bug where onDetect method was being called multiple times
* [Android] Fix Gradle 8 compatibility by adding the `namespace` attribute to the build.gradle.

Improvements:
* [Android] Upgraded camera2 dependency
* Added zoomScale value notifier in MobileScannerController for the application to know the zoom scale value set actually.
  The value is notified from the native SDK(CameraX/AVFoundation).
* Added resetZoomScale() in MobileScannerController to reset zoom ratio with 1x.
  Both Android and iOS, if the device have ultra-wide camera, calling setZoomScale with small value causes to use ultra-wide camera and may be diffcult to detect barcodes.
  resetZoomScale() is useful to use standard camera with zoom 1x.
  setZoomScale() with the specific value can realize same effect, but added resetZoomScale for avoiding floating point errors.
  The application can know what zoom scale value is selected actually by subscribing zoomScale above after calling resetZoomScale.
* [iOS] Call resetZoomScale while starting scan.
  Android camera is initialized with a zoom of 1x, whereas iOS is initialized with the minimum zoom value, which causes to select the ultra-wide camera unintentionally ([iOS] Impossible to focus and scan the QR code due to picking the wide back camera #554).
  Fixed this issue by calling resetZoomScale
* [iOS] Remove zoom animation with ramp function to match Android behavior.

## 3.2.0
Improvements:
* [iOS] Updated GoogleMLKit/BarcodeScanning to 4.0.0 
* [Android] Updated com.google.mlkit:barcode-scanning from 17.0.3 to 17.1.0

Bugs fixed:
* [iOS] Fixed a bug that caused a crash when switching from camera.

## 3.1.0
Improvements:
* [iOS] No longer automatically focus on faces.
* [iOS] Fixed build error.
* [Web] Waiting for js libs to load.
* Do not returnImage if not specified.
* Added raw data in barcode object.
* Fixed several bugs.

## 3.0.0
This big release contains all improvements from the beta releases.
In addition to that, this release contains:

Improvements:
* Fixed an issue in which the scanner would freeze if two scanner widgets where placed in a page view,
and the paged was swiped. An example has been added in the example app.
You need to set startDelay: true if used in a page view.
* [Web] Automatically inject js libraries.
* [macOS] The minimum build version is now macOS 10.14 in according to the latest Flutter version.
* [Android] Fixed an issue in which the scanWindow would remain even after disposing the scanner.
* Updated dependencies.

## 3.0.0-beta.4
Fixes:
* Fixes a permission bug on Android where denying the permission would cause an infinite loop of permission requests.
* Updates the example app to handle permission errors with the new builder parameter.
  Now it no longer throws uncaught exceptions when the permission is denied.
* Updated several dependencies

Features:
* Added a new `errorBuilder` to the `MobileScanner` widget that can be used to customize the error state of the preview. (Thanks @navaronbracke !) 

## 3.0.0-beta.3
Deprecated:
* The `onStart` method has been renamed to `onScannerStarted`.
* The `onPermissionSet` argument of the `MobileScannerController` is now deprecated.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

* `MobileScannerException` now uses an `errorCode` instead of a `message`.
* `MobileScannerException` now contains additional details from the original error.
* Refactored `MobileScannerController.start()` to throw `MobileScannerException`s
  with consistent error codes, rather than string messages.
  To handle permission errors, consider catching the result of `MobileScannerController.start()`.
* The `autoResume` attribute has been removed from the `MobileScanner` widget.
  The controller already automatically resumes, so it had no effect.
* Removed `MobileScannerCallback` and `MobileScannerArgumentsCallback` typedef.
* [Web] Replaced `jsqr` library with `zxing-js` for full barcode support.

Improvements:
* Toggling the device torch now does nothing if the device has no torch, rather than throwing an error.
* Removed `called stop while already stopped` messages.

Features:
* You can now provide a `scanWindow` to the `MobileScanner()` widget.
* You can now draw an overlay over the scanned barcode. See the barcode scanner window in the example app for more information.
* Added a new `placeholderBuilder` function to the `MobileScanner` widget to customize the preview placeholder.
* Added `autoStart` parameter to MobileScannerController(). If set to false, controller won't start automatically.
* Added `hasTorch` function on MobileScannerController(). After starting the controller, you can check if the device has a torch.
* [iOS] Support `torchEnabled` parameter from MobileScannerController() on iOS
* [Web] Added ability to use custom barcode scanning js libraries 
  by extending `WebBarcodeReaderBase` class and changing `barCodeReader` property in `MobileScannerWebPlugin`

Fixes:
* Fixes the missing gradle setup for the Android project, which prevented gradle sync from working.
* Fixes `MobileScannerController.stop()` throwing when already stopped.
* Fixes `MobileScannerController.toggleTorch()` throwing if the device has no torch.
  Now it does nothing if the torch is not available.
* Fixes a memory leak where the `MobileScanner` would keep listening to the barcode events.
* Fixes the `MobileScanner` preview depending on all attributes of `MediaQueryData`.
  Now it only depends on its layout constraints.
* Fixed a potential crash when the scanner is restarted due to the app being resumed.
* [iOS] Fix crash when changing torch state
  
## 3.0.0-beta.2

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

* The arguments parameter of onDetect is removed. The data is now returned by the onStart callback
in the MobileScanner widget.
* onDetect now returns the object BarcodeCapture, which contains a List of barcodes and, if enabled, an image.
* allowDuplicates is removed and replaced by MobileScannerSpeed enum.
* onPermissionSet in MobileScanner widget is deprecated and will be removed. Use the onPermissionSet
onPermissionSet callback in MobileScannerController instead.
* [iOS] The minimum deployment target is now 11.0 or higher.

Features:
* The returnImage is working for both iOS and Android. You can enable it in the MobileScannerController.
The image will be returned in the BarcodeCapture object provided by onDetect.
* You can now control the DetectionSpeed, as well as the timeout of the DetectionSpeed. For more
info see the DetectionSpeed documentation. This replaces the allowDuplicates function.

Other improvements:
* Both the [iOS] and [Android] codebases have been refactored completely.
* [iOS] Updated POD dependencies

## 3.0.0-beta.1
